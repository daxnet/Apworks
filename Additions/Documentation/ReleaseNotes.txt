=== 2012/06/30 Apworks Application Development Framework version 2.5.4563.21309 ===
Installation Prerequisites:
1. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 SP1
2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1
3. Other required libraries & assemblies are now included in the installation package
   so no more prerequisites needed

Functional Updates:
1. Refactor the identity field of the IEntity interface from 'Id' to 'ID'
2. Changed the MySql Storage to use the MySql NetConnector version 6.4.4.
3. Implemented the paging support for the repositories.
4. Added the Eager Loading Property specification to repository interface 
   to support eager loading of navigation properties in some 3rd party repository implementation.
5. Updated the 3rd party assembly references to their latest version.
6. Added the EntityFramework repository implementation.
7. Changed the type of the ID of entities from System.Long to System.Guid.
8. WcfPerRequestLifetimeManager added to the Unity object container.
9. Added the NHibernateApplicationConfiguration class
10. Project templates available for Visual Studio 2010
11. New DataTransferObject type available in the new Apworks.Services.ApplicationServices namespace

Hotfixes:
1. try_catch block should be used on the transaction rollback action to prevent the exception 
   from being dropped in NHibernateContext.
2. NHibernate Session should be cleared when exception occurs.
3. Fixed the XML document for the repository class.


=== 2011/09/15 Apworks Application Development Framework version 2.5.4563.21309 ===
Installation Prerequisites:
1. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 SP1
2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1
3. Other required libraries & assemblies are now included in the installation package
   so no more prerequisites needed

Functional Updates:
1. Fixed lots of bugs exist in the previous version of Apworks.
2. Messaging and Dispatching now supports both DirectBus and MSMQ. Using MSMQ as event bus along
   with Microsoft SQL Server will gain the benefit of Distributed Transaction Coordination (Requires
   Windows system starts the MS-DTC service).
3. Event Store now supports either SQL Server or MySQL databases. In order to avoid the 2PC (Two-Phase-Commit)
   failure, we suggest use SQL Server as your event store since MySQL is not supported by the MS-DTC.
4. Flexible Event Snapshot mechanism. Developers are able to customize and configure the snapshot providers
   so that different snapshot strategies could be applied on the domain repositories.
5. Supports different types of domain repositories.
6. Supports the latest version of NHibernate (3.2.0GA) framework. This improves the performance when getting
   a list of matching domain objects.
7. IStorage interface now supports the ISpecification interface instead of the PropertyBag object to
   implement the filtering. This means that complex search conditions could be applied on the storages
   when retrieving objects.
8. Fixed the issue of the Lambda Expression on the ISpecification implementation to support Microsoft
   ADO.NET Entity Framework.
9. Different configuration approaches. Developers can use either configuration file (app/web.config)
   or inline code to provide configuration information for Apworks framework. Inline code configuration provides
   strongly-typed, intellisense-supported coding styles whereas configuration file provides more
   flexible configuration after the application has been deployed to the production environment.
10. Interceptions and Exception Handling mechanism is introduced in this version of Apworks.
11. New application bootstrapper. 

=== 2010/12/27 Apworks/CQRS framework (Alpha) version 1.0.4016.23016 ===
Installation Prerequisites
1. Install .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
2. Install Visual Studio 2010 (with SQL Express)
3. Install EntLib 5: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff632023.aspx
4. Microsoft SQL Server (Express) 2005 or above

Functional Checkpoints:
1. Messaging and Dispatching with DirectBus - The Command side and Query side should resides within
   the same server environment since the current version of Apworks only supports the Direct In-memory
   message bus.
2. Event Store and Snapshots - Currently only supports SQL Server as the back store of the events and
   snapshots. However developers could extend the framework to support other storage devices. Further 
   development will include the support of various RDBMS and NoSQL solutions.
3. Query Data Storage - Currently only supports SQL Server. However developers could extend the framework
   to support other storage devices. Further development will include the support of various RDBMS and NoSQL
   solutions.
4. Object Containers - Only supports Unity Framework in Microsoft Patterns & Practices EntLib 5.0. Apworks
   provides a proxy library on decoupling and accessing the Unity Framework.
5. Snapshot Strategies - Currently the snapshot strategy is defined as a simple CanCreateOrUpdateSnapshot
   method under the IDomainEventStorage interface, and the current strategy is that, for every 1000 events
   of an aggregate, the snapshot will be taken. As the current version of Apworks uses the SqlDomainEventStorage
   class as the concrete class of IDomainEventStorage interface, so by overriding the CanCreateOrUpdateSnapshot
   method you could define your own snapshot strategy.
6. The PropertyBag only supports the 'equals' and 'AND' semantics. Will be enhanced in later versions.
